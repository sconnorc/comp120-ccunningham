Assignment #3: MessageHub Native App
Connor Cunningham
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The post request method and corresponding submission alert were successfully implemented for this assignment. Unfortunately, the get request was not
implemented in time for submission.

One view was created with three objects - a button,
text field, and text view.  Both the text field and 
text view were declared as properties in the view
control.  A method, changeColor, was created and
called on the click of the button.  Within the method,
a request was generated with text from the text view
and text field, and with proper heading the request
was sent to local host port 3000 for testing on
messagehub. Several other methods were created to
enhance usability of the input fields on the view.
